Run cuda-particles.exe to start the simulation.

Controls:

Left Mouse Button   : explode
Right Mouse Button  : suction
Middle Mouse Button : spawn

You may customize its behavior by editing config.json 
before launching the exe.

Additionally, you may run other config files through it
by dragging them onto the executable with your mouse
(for example, drag "lava.json" on top of cuda-particles.exe
for a lava simulation).

Another way to do this is to run cuda-particles.exe on the
command line. Pass the name of the config file as an argument
to it.
